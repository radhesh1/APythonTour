    "Python was originally developed as a teaching language, but its ease of use and clean syntax have made it popular among both beginners and experts. The clarity of Python's syntax has earned it the nickname \"executable pseudocode.\" From my experience, reading and understanding a Python script is often much easier than deciphering a similar script written in C.\n",
